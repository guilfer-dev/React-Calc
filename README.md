# React Calc
 A simple calculator writen in ReactJS.

 The main porpose was testing CSS skills, but I also had to use React Hooks and manage more behaviors than I was expecting.
 Like many other in my Github, this one was made without any look into similar projects as a challange to improove myself.

 It was a fun project and it has turned out to be a nice looking one too.
